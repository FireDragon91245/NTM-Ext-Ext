# <u>**pain**</u>

Here's version of NTM that i decided to modify from Extended Edition 2.0.1, since the mod suddenly stopped receiving updates<br>
This is more of a local project not focused on production, and also I have no experience in Java coding, so it's not recommended for a wide use lol

It is forked from Extended Edition made by [Alcater](https://github.com/Alcatergit/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)<br>
which is forked from the fork made by [TheOriginalGolem](https://github.com/TheOriginalGolem/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)<br>
which is forked from the port made by [Drillgon200](https://github.com/Drillgon200/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)<br>
which is ported from the original mod made by [HBMTheBobcat](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).

Details are on their README's. What I want to say here is that GitHub is way, WAY too confusing to me I have no idea how to mark this repository as a proper fork of Extended Edition. Sigh.

(update: internet say it's impossible to mark as a fork retroactively. ntm hamster reloaded also lacks the "forked from" thingy so im happy im not the only one lol)
